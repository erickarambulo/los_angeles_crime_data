# Los Angeles Crime Data
Hello and welcome to my project of Los Angeles Crime Data!
# Description
This project contains all rows from year 2020 to 2024. I focused on creating data visualizations based on victim's age, sex, and descent.
# Note
This Data is truncated by 27.04% due to deleting rows of negative numbers for age column, zeros for age column, missing values for victims' sex, descent, and age. I also removed X (unknown) and H values for victims' gender. All of that resulted from 966951 rows to 705449 rows.
